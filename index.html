<p>Hello. I am Corey Bowes and this is my programming portfolio. Below are program(s) that I have written myself with the code provided as a sample of my work.

Tic Tac Toe: Written in C++. A simple Tic Tac Toe game that allows the user to play a game of Tic Tac Toe against another player on the same computer or against an AI opponent at one of three difficulty levels, or to watch two AI players play against each other. The code can be found on Github <a href="https://github.com/CoreyBowes/Tic-Tac-Toe">here</a>, and the game can be played in a web browser <a href="https://goo.gl/KM2XxT">here</a>.
